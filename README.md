# Baekjoon Algorithm Training

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

This repository contains solutions and notes 
for algorithm training. It is organized to help track progress and manage solution files effectively. 
Each directory corresponds to a category of algorithms, and each solution is named according to its problem ID on Baekjoon Site or Progammers Site.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Sorting**: Contains problems related to sorting algorithms.
- **Graph Theory**: Contains problems involving graphs, traversals, and graph-related algorithms.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solutions for dynamic programming problems.
- **Data Structures**: Contains implementations and problem solutions related to data structures.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Solutions for greedy algorithm problems.
- **Mathematics**: Mathematical problems including number theory, combinatorics, etc.

Each directory includes:
- **Solution Files**: `.java` or `.py` files containing solution code.
- **Explanation Files**: `.md` files explaining the problem approach and solution details.
